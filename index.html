        <div class="btxt">
          <p>I am a 15 year old frontend developer, I am decent with HTML and CSS, but JavaScript is not my thing. I am not good with any of the other web frameworks as I would rather stick to finishing my profecciency on HTML, CSS, and JS before I mess around with any other frameworks. <br>In the future, I see myself going for a professional frontend development job. I could help with giving you tips on how I get inspiration for my code, or what motivates me when I feel like coding. <br>Backend development is not my thing, I plan on learning C, C#, C++ and some other coding languages though. <br>When I am not coding, I spend time playing games with my friends on discord, or chatting with my family. <br>Privacy is something I care a lot about. I suggest some web projects and other things to keep your info yours. </p>
